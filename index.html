		<p><b>A gradual decrease in abortion rates across Alabama, Arkansas and the state of New York occurred between 2010 and 2016, according to data compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization for sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States.</b></p>

		<p>Abortion was decriminalized by the United States Supreme Court in 1973, yet in the first half of the past decade, numbers began to shrink across the country.</p>
		<p>The causes of this decline are not certain, but initial research suggests it is due to tightening restrictions on abortion in some states, in addition to wider access to contraceptives and decreasing pregnancy rates across the country.</p>

		<p>Before 2010, no states banned abortions outright at any stage of pregnancy, according to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/states-banned-abortions/story?id=18703520">ABCNews</a>.
		</p>
		<p>But, since 2010, the abortion landscape has grown more restrictive, Guttmacher Institute reports.</p>

		<h2>A look at why that could be</h2>
		<h3>Better education, access to contraception, family planning</h3>
		
		<p>These three factors could explain the decrease in abortion rates across the United States.</p>

		<p>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr060.pdf">study by the Center for Disease Control</a> found an increasing number of women aged 15-44 in the U.S. are using a method of contraception, but that "women's use of contraceptive methods varies depending on their insurance coverage, their income, and their residential location."</p>

		<p>In addition, higher levels of education (Bachelor's and higher) correlated with higher use of hormonal contraceptives: "three times as many women with a bachelor's degree or higher rely on the pill (35%) compared with women with less than a high school diploma (11%)." <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr060.pdf">National Health Statistics Report</a></p>

		
		<br>


		<h3>Legislative obstacles</h3>
			<p>Between January 1, 2011 and July 1, 2019, states enacted 483 new abortion restrictions, and these account for nearly 40% of all abortion restrictions enacted by states in the decades since Roe v. Wade. - (Guttmacher Institute).</p>
			<p>In 2010, Nebraska was the first U.S. state to pass a 20-week abortion ban.</p>
			<p>In 2011, Alabama and four other states banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. (Reuters)</p>
			<p>In 2013, Arkansas passed "the nation's most restrictive abortion law" according to several media reports. The Arkansas Heartbeat Protection Act efectively banned abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
			<p><b>More than three million pregnancies are <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/moving-forward-family-planning-era-health-reform">unintended</a> in the U.S. each year. That represents about 50% of all pregnancies across the U.S.<b></p>

			<br>

			<h3>Growing access to contraceptives and education about sexual reproduction are instrumental in reducing these occurrences, but increasing legal challenges to abortions also have an incidence on access to abortions.</h3>
